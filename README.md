# Digital Lending Product – Product Owner Case Study

This repository demonstrates my approach as a Product Owner working on a digital lending product
within a banking environment, covering discovery, strategy, delivery, and measurement.


## Problem Statement

and operational inefficiencies.


## Target Users
- Retail customers (salary-based personal loans)

Enable fast, transparent, and data-driven loan applications with clear eligibility,
status tracking, and reduced time-to-decision.


## Success Metrics (KPIs)
- Time to credit decision
- Application completion rate
- Drop-off per funnel step
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Cost per approved loan


## MVP Scope
- Eligibility pre-check
- Digital loan application
